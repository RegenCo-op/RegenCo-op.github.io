## Compose the Article
{: .center .dark .teal}

Before you start writing the article, it is recommended that you read the [article formatting guidelines](/info/Article-Formatting-Guidelines) to get familiar with the basics of how our articles are formatted.

1. ### Download the template article:
   
   - Right click on the following link and click save link as... to save it to your desktop: [ArticleTemplate.md](https://github.com/RegenCo-op/RegenCo-op/raw/master/docs/_articles/ArticleTemplate.md)

2. ### Open the file from step 1 in your favorite Markdown editor:  
   **Note:** A good online editor is [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/editor), and from now on we will assume you are using that editor for the purposes of this guide:
   
   1. Using Stack Edit, for example, click on the "**#**" in the upper left corner.
   2. Click on "import from disk".
   3. Click "browse" and open the file from step 1.

3. ### Write the article:  
   **Note:** Do not worry about pictures for now.
   
   1. #### Fill out the top section:
      
      1. **Ignore the first line that says layout: article**
      2. Delete the text that says "Article Title Goes Here" and fill it in with your article's title.
      3. Delete the text that says "Unique-Article-Permalink-Goes-Here" and replace it with a phrase that is unique.  
        **No spaces are allowed. Only letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and hyphens (-) are allowed**.  
        The easiest thing would be your article's title, replacing the spaces with hyphens (-). For example: using the title: `My Article Title`, one would choose a permalink: `My-Article-Title`.  
        The most important thing is that it **doesn't share a permalink with another article**.  
        **_Make a note of what you typed here, as we will use it later, as follows:_** `Your-Permalink-Here`
      4. **Most articles should leave the _comments: true_ section alone.**

   2. #### Write the content:  
      Now you can start writing your article after the last line with the three hyphens (`---`).
      
      - Make a note of where you want to put a picture, if any, but do not worry about how to insert it for now.
      - Keep in mind the [article formatting guidelines](/info/Article-Formatting-Guidelines).
      - Also remember to refer to the [Kramdown reference guide](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) if the text isn't formatting the way you want it to.

   3. #### Rename the article:
      
      1. Using Stack Edit, click on the text in the upper right that says `ArticleTemplate`.
      2. Using the same permalink text you used in step 3, rename the article. It will look like this:  
      `Your-Permalink-Here`

   4. #### Save the article:
     
      1. Using Stack Edit, for example, click on the "**#**" in the upper left corner.
      2. Click the "**Export to disk**" button.
      3. Click the "As markdown" button.

4. ### Using images:  
   **Note:** Skip to the next step if you _do not_ want to use any pictures.
   
   1. #### Prepare the images:
      
      1. Make sure pictures you want to use are copyright free or are your own original work.
      2. Rename the files so that they **do not contain any spaces**.
      3. Make sure the files are .jpeg, .png, .gif, or .svg format (you can use this [online converter](http://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-jpg) if they are not).
      4. [Compress the files here](https://compressor.io/). Compressed images make the page load faster and improve user experience for people with a slow internet connection.
      5. Put all the images you want to use in a folder on your desktop. Rename the folder the same as your permalink:  
`Your-Permalink-Here`

   2. #### Insert the images into the document:  
      **Note: _Images you use here won't appear in any previews_**
      
      - Using the markdown format, insert the images into the article wherever you want. The format you use will look like this: `![image description](/images/Your-Permalink-Here/Your-Image-Here.ext)`  
        
        **Note:** Make sure to replace `Your-Permalink-Here` with the same permalink text you used in step 3.  
        **Note:** Make sure to replace `Your-Image-Here.ext` with the image filename, and **don't forget to use the right filename extension**.

## Make a New Fork
{: .center .dark .teal}

**Note:** You only need to follow these steps one time; In the future you can skip to the [next section](#submit-your-article-to-github).

1. Either [sign into github](https://github.com/login) or [make a new account](https://github.com/join).
2. Go to the [RegenCo-op repository on GitHub](https://github.com/RegenCo-op/RegenCo-op).
3. In the upper right corner, you will see a button called "Fork". Click on it to fork the repository to your account.
4. After a few seconds, you should now have a personal copy of all the files on the website.
5. It would be wise to make a bookmark of your forked repository, as that is what you will use to submit articles. If you do not, you can find it later at:  
   `https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME-HERE/RegenCo-op`

## Submit Your Article to GitHub
{: .center .dark .teal}

By now you should have your article written and named: `Your-Permalink-Here.md` along with your images folder named: `Your-Permalink-Here`. You should also have [forked the RegenCo-op repository](#set-up-a-new-fork) and be signed into your [Github account](https://github.com/login). You are ready to submit your article to the website to be reviewed and published by members of the co-operative.

1. ### Updating your fork:  
   As people make changes to the main repository, your fork will become out of date. Follow these steps to keep your fork updated:
   
   1. Select the following text, and copy and paste it to your browser's address bar: `https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME-HERE/RegenCo-op/compare/master...RegenCo-op:master`
   2. Replace the text `YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME-HERE` with _your_ github username.
   3. Press the `Enter` key to begin comparing the changes between the website and your forked repository.
   4. If it says "**There isn't anything to compare.**", skip to step 2, otherwise click the button that says "**Create pull request**".
   5. Give your pull request the title "**Update**" and click "**Create pull request**".
   6. Now you can click the "**Merge pull request**" button to bring your repository up to date with the master repository.

2. ### Making a topic branch:
   
   A topic branch is a short-lived branch that we will create and use for a single article, to make it easier to see what changes were made.

   1. Go to your forked repository. It can be found here:  
      `https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME-HERE/RegenCo-op`
   2. Click on the button that says "Branch: **master**".
   3. In the input box, type in the permalink text: `Your-Permalink-Here`
   4. Click the "Create branch:..." button.
   
3. ### Making and Pushing Changes:
   
   Now we will add our article and images folder (if you used images) to GitHub.  
   **_Note:_ Make sure your branch is on the one you created earlier during each step of this process.**

   1. #### Upload the article file:

      1. Open the "**docs**" folder.

      5. The image's filenames should appear under the grey box.
      6. Scroll down and click the "**Commit changes**" button at the bottom.

   3. #### Edit the article layout:
      
      1. Open the "**docs**" folder.
