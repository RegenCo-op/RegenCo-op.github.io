Regen Co-op strives to make it easy for as many people to help contribute to the organization in as many ways as possible. If at any point you find it difficult to contribute, please don't hesitate to [contact us](/info/contact); we will help you with any troubles you're having. By participating and contributing we grow as a community and have a greater impact on the world than by simply doing things on our own.

As a non-member, you are allowed to [make comments](#making-comments), [suggest changes to articles](#improving-an-article), [write new articles](#writing-a-new-article), and [help fund the co-operative](#funding-the-co-operative). [Becoming a member](#todo) allows you to do those things with a louder voice. Contributions by members have the biggest impact on the direction the co-operative takes. Members are what _makes_ this a co-operative, and their contributions are taken more seriously. Members and non-members can contribute to the co-operative in the following ways:

- ## Making Comments:

  Comments are meant to be a place for discussion of the topics within an article. If you liked, disliked, or had questions about the article, don't hesitate to comment about it.

  To make comments, notice that below each article there is a comment section provided by a third-party called Disqus. You can comment as a guest (without creating an account), but must wait for moderator approval of your message before it appears on the website. You can also create an account with Disqus, and not have to wait for moderator approval of your message.


- ## Improving an Article:

  If you notice a grammatical, spelling, or some other error in an article, we allow users to suggest edits to articles to improve them (somewhat like Wikipedia).

  To improve an article, notice that in the upper right corner of every article  there is a small pencil icon: <svg width="31" height="47" viewBox="0 0 84 125" class="icon-pencil"><g transform="rotate(-30, 49, 64)" stroke="black" ><path fill="pink" d="m69 23c-10-10-30-10-40 0 0 0 0-20 0-20 10-10 30-10 40 0 0 0 0 20 0 20zM69 93"/><path fill="orange" d="m69 93c0 0 0-70 0-70 -10-10-30-10-40 0 0 0 0 70 0 70 11-11 31-9 40 0zm-28-77c0 0 0 70 0 70m15 0c0 0 0-70 0-70"/><path fill="Bisque" d="m69 93c0 0-15 30-15 30 -3-1-8-1-10 0 0 0-15-30-15-30 11-11 31-9 40 0z"/><path fill="black" d="m49 133c0 0 5-10 5-10 -3-1-8-1-10 0 0 0 5 10 5 10z"/></g></svg>
  
  Moving your mouse cursor over the icon will show you that you can improve that page. Clicking the icon will take you to Github, where we store and keep updated all the articles of our website. If you are not logged into Github, you will be taken to a Github login screen. If you do not have a Github account, click on the link that says "Create an account", otherwise log into your account. After you have done this, you will be taken to the article's editing page.

  Before you start editing the article, it is recommended to read the [article formatting guidelines](/info/Article-Formatting-Guidelines). The guidelines will describe how our articles are written and what the special symbols mean. 
  
  Once you have read the guidelines, feel free to make any changes you wish. Once finished, at the bottom of the page there will be a section called "Propose file change". Please type in a description of what changes you did and why, and click the "Propose file change" button.

  Changes to an article will then be sent to site moderators for approval.

- ## Writing a New Article:
  
  If you wish to propose a new article, we allow both members and non-members to do so. Articles are reviewed by members before being published on the website; furthermore, articles by non-members are reviewed with more scrutiny.

  Please follow the guide on [How to Write a New Article](/info/How-to-Write-a-New-Article) for more information.

- ## Funding the Co-operative:
  
  _Coming soon._
