## Model for a Sustainable Future
{: .center}

### Mission Statement: To bring people together to find and implement solutions to allow a sustainable future for all people and all life. 

The  guiding principles of the REGENCO-OP are to live in balance and harmony with each other and with nature. To do this requires us to reduce inefficiency and put the power and consequently the responsibility back into the hands of the common person. The current economic and sociopolitical systems currently in use feedback on each other to reward both waste and the consolidation of power. 
	
The current dominant ideology in the world is not religious, it's not political it is economical and that ideology is Capitalism. The Capitalist system uses the corporation and its [hierarchical organization](/articles/Hierarchical-Organization) to concentrate resources a.k.a wealth a.k.a. capital to the top tiers of the hierarchy. Along with its hierarchical structure it is an open linear system by which concentration of wealth at the top is equaled by concentration of pollution at the bottom, this is contradictory to the closed loop cyclical system that is the ecology of the biosphere. 

Capitalism is also highly competitive. Workers compete with other workers to get the best paying job. Once you have a job you compete to move up the hierarchy to gain status and wealth and the “privilege” of bossing other people around. If you are lucky enough to make it to the top of your corporation you then compete with other corporations for market share and these markets then compete with other markets.

Several things are not commonly known about corporations. The first of these is that nation states are corporations,  when you pledge your allegiance to your country it is no morally different than pledging it to Walmart or Monsanto yet not many would accept dieing for or accepting to be taxed by these corporations. Municipalities are corporations and this gives the minority that incorporates it legal power to control the activities, even lock them in cages with their police force and collect taxes of its residences within its jurisdiction. Again would we accept a Walmart employee putting us into a cage or evicting us from our home if we failed to pay our taxes? The Federal Reserve bank is a private corporation with the same incentive placed upon it as any other and that is the legal requirement to make a profit for its shareholders, who are the Federal Government of the United States (remember, another corporation) and the list of shareholders whose numbers and names have been kept secret since the Fed's founding in 1913. The central banking system of the world controls the money supply. This false wealth, this worthless resource, is the tool by which real resources are extracted from Mother Earth and then abused by the minority that sits at the top. Please ask this simple question: who is the national debts of countries around the world owed to exactly and why?  

This competitive hierarchical structure is the root cause of both our social and environmental problems. Even though we have talked about Capitalism this hierarchical societal organization has existed since the beginnings of civilization. Some question whether civilization is compatible with ecology. We believe it is as long as civilization is organized in an ecological way. Therefore the REGENCO-OP is structured as an anarchical organization, that is, as voluntary free association co-operative that is unincorporated. We are a place for people who want to take on the responsibility and reap the rewards of insuring theirs, their children's and grandchildren’s etc. sustainable existence.  

### We know that we must co-operate to regenerate life!

Current areas of focus:

 - Using the  principles of a voluntary free association co-operative and the tools provided by the internet  develop an organizational system that allows the Mission of REGenCo-op to be realized.

 - To create a completely renewable and environmentally balanced power production, storage and usage system that is scaleable to the average suburban USA household, farm homestead, small business and ecovillage. This system will provide all the energy needs and comforts modernity requires. 

 - This is a fully integrated system producing food, electricity, HVAC, cooking heat, hot water, refrigeration and even water itself by the condensation of  the humidity in the air. This system will use diversified sources for the collection of energy and store the energy in thermal batteries, a hot one and a cold one. 

 - This heat differential drives a Stirling engine to run a generator to produce electricity and provide direct mechanical power for running things such as water pumps, grain mills, machine tools and most common machinery.

 - Energy stored in the hot thermal battery can be used directly to provide living space heating, cooking heat, hot water and some light industrial processes
 
 - The cold thermal battery is created by an absorptive cooler like that found in RV refrigerators using environmentally benign ammonia and water as the refrigerant and/or driving a smaller Stirling engine with the power producing Stirling engine. When a Stirling engine is driven by another motor it becomes a compressive cooling device like most common air conditioning systems but does not require expensive or environmentally dangerous refrigerants.
 
 - From the cold thermal battery food storage freezing and refrigeration is provided as well as living space cooling along with the ability to extract water from the atmosphere through condensation onto cold surfaces. 
 
 - With this technology create a co-operative economic system to disseminate the power systems so everyone has low cost sustainable power. REGenCo-op members would be the first to benefit from this  technology. 
	
 - Focus needs to be placed on a methodology of getting power to the  poor. With power all other needs can then be addressed. 

 - Examine our current use of energy by calculating the the true cost of the production and distribution of goods and services. With this information identify inefficiencies and create solutions to reduce the inefficiencies.

 - Identify and implement current social and technological trends that complement the objectives of the REGenCo-op.
