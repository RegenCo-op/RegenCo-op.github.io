![diagram of hierarchical organization](/images/compressed/Hierarchical-Organization/HierarchicalOrganization.png)	
The above is a diagram graphically demonstrating hierarchical organization. The first thing to note is the pyramidal shape. The pyramid is ubiquitous to civilization. Many have thought that the pyramid has magical power, that it concentrates energy in some way or can shield things from harm or decay. The symbology of the pyramid represents the hierarchical organization of society and so there is no magic, for those at the top of the hierarchy  do acquire these powers.  The ancient pyramids were built by first leveling the spot the pyramid will stand. This is representative of civilizations subjugation of nature. Then the first course of stone blocks is laid and another slightly smaller is laid upon that and so on. This is representative of the class structure of civilization where each class is supported by the one below. The very top of the pyramid is always given prominence either as the alter of sacrifice or as a shining beacon. This represents how the leader is to be followed to the point of self sacrifice. Patriarchy and hierarchy are one and the same. The obelisk presents a pyramid in the form of a phallus. Yes the Washington monument is a 555 foot tall, aluminum capped, marble brick DICK!

In the diagram above the Earth is represented by the flat line at the bottom. This is an open line with no beginning and no end and represents the idea of limitless resources and pollution without consequence. Resources are things like agriculture, mineral ores and oil but also things like human ingenuity and information. The term resource extraction can be substituted with the tem THEFT. This is seen in the operation of industrialism and in the profit motive and taxes. Pollution is physical things like CO2 emissions, landfills and oil spills but also mind pollution like political, religious and scientific propaganda, commercial advertising and compulsory state sponsored education, in other words LIES. Commands are either direct from the master to the slave or are present in the form of LAWS. Allowances are in form of MONEY and RIGHTS (and you thought rights were social progress!).

The etymology of the word hierarchy is late 14th century, jerarchie, ierarchie, "rank in the sacred order; one of the three divisions of the nine orders of angels;" loosely, "rule, dominion," from Old French ierarchie (14c., Modern French hi√©rarchie), from Medieval Latin hierarchia "ranked division of angels" (in the system of Dionysius the Areopagite), from Greek hierarkhia "rule of a high priest," from hierarkhes "high priest, leader of sacred rites," from ta hiera "the sacred rites" (neuter plural of hieros "sacred;" see ire) + arkhein "to lead, rule" (see archon). Sense of "ranked organization of persons or things" first recorded 1610s, initially of clergy, sense probably influenced by higher. Its modern meaning is, 1. any system of persons or things ranked one above another. 2. government by ecclesiastical rulers. 3. the power or dominion of a hierarch. 4. an organized body of ecclesiastical officials in successive ranks or orders: the Roman Catholic hierarchy. 5. one of the three divisions of the angels, each made up of three orders, conceived as constituting a graded body. 6. Also called celestial hierarchy. the collective body of angels. 7. government by an elite group.
