The reasons for scaling the system to this size and the utilization of solar thermal are many. The first consideration is what is the current demand for energy and where is that demand most valued, what are we not willing to give up easily in the name of environmental responsibility? These things are abundant clean water, abundant healthy and delicious food, abundant healthy and comfortable living spaces, safe and expedient transportation, and the access to global information and communication. We have found ways that may be able to provide these desires in a environmentally responsible way. 

Let's look at some data on our energy consumption and production. The USA is still the largest energy consumers in the world followed by China and because the USA gets a large amount of products from China the energy used to make those should be attributed to the USA as the final consumer  according to:

[List of countries by total primary energy consumption and production.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_primary_energy_consumption_and_production) 

Contrary to the total energy used the USA is way down the list in energy use per capita according to:

[List of countries by energy consumption per capita.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_energy_consumption_per_capita) 

By studying the list of energy use per capita you will find the largest consumer is Iceland. The list doesn’t reflect where the energy comes just how much is used. Iceland gets  over half of its energy from geothermal while the USA gets most its energy from fossil fuels. 	
	
Energy use per capita is a very strong indicator of the standard of living so by making a large portion of the energy production from renewable sources and directly at the benefit of the individual a huge shift in the economy would happen and if Iceland is an example it would be for the better. It would also create social change as large international corporations and governments hold power over the population by the distribution of this energy. It’s no coincidence that  those in power are called that, it is because they are the ones who control and regulate the use of energy.
	
It is difficult to get people re-accustomed to a different standard of living, to be forced to “rough it” in the name of environmental responsibility. This is a myth perpetuated by the established energy industry. As Iceland shows you can have a high standard of living and plenty of power for the individual to do what they want with renewable energy. Granted Iceland is a special case in that they have an overabundance of geothermal energy available and it is still more or less centrally distributed it is an interesting example of what is possible.   

Even where geothermal energy is not viable there exists in many areas of the world enough solar energy available in all its various forms to easily satisfy our needs. According to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy :

*The Earth receives 174 petawatts (PW) of incoming solar radiation (insolation) at the upper atmosphere. Approximately 30% is reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds, oceans and land masses. The spectrum of solar light at the Earth's surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges with a small part in the near-ultraviolet.*

*Earth's land surface, oceans and atmosphere absorb solar radiation, and this raises their temperature. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anticyclones. Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14 °C. By photosynthesis green plants convert solar energy into chemical energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.*

***Yearly Solar fluxes:*** 
*Solar	3,850,000 EJ*
*Wind	2,250 EJ*
*Biomass potential	100–300 EJ*

***Human Energy Consumption:***
*Primary energy use (2010)	539 EJ*
*Electricity (2010)	66.5 EJ*

*The total solar energy absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, oceans and land masses is approximately 3,850,000 exajoules (EJ) per year. In 2002, this was more energy in one hour than the world used in one year. Photosynthesis captures approximately 3,000 EJ per year in biomass. The technical potential available from biomass is from 100–300 EJ/year. The amount of solar energy reaching the surface of the planet is so vast that in one year it is about twice as much as will ever be obtained from all of the Earth's non-renewable resources of coal, oil, natural gas, and mined uranium combined.*

**The last sentence needs repeating: *The amount of solar energy reaching the surface of the planet is so vast that in one year it is about twice as much as will ever be obtained from all of the Earth's non-renewable resources of coal, oil, natural gas, and mined uranium combined*!!!**
 	
 This doesn’t mean we can ever use all that energy, or should for that matter for the rest of life needs this energy for its survival also. The point is that the energy is there, and will be for billions of more years. 
	
It is claimed that the cost of power generated by using the sun is higher than that of fossil fuels. The problem is the economics they use to make this claim is flawed. Every business that invests in something has an expected time to be able to recuperate their investment. The problem is when solar plants are compared to fossil fuels it takes longer to get your return on investment but ignore that once the return is made your only expenses are a small labor force to monitor and maintain the plant and the maintenance costs themselves. Current fossil fuel use requires huge mines, deep sea oil wells, giant tanker ships, fleets of trucks or questionable pipelines, giant complicated power plants and then go on to pollute the environment. Little of this is factored into the cost of the power plant itself especially the end results it has on our environment and future. Even so the current way of harvesting solar energy, both photovoltaics and large solar thermal “farms” have problems.

The biggest problem with photovoltaics is they only make low voltage DC current. They are getting better all the time at doing that but that’s still all they do. This This low voltage DC current must be converted to a higher voltage AC current to work the appliances in our homes and businesses and this is inefficient. The actual electrical usage of things that could not operate on some other energy source is small in the home and many small businesses. The biggest usage in power comes from heating things up and cooling things down which electricity must be converted to do these things so efficiency is lost. Another problem with them is their energy storage. By using batteries, toxic and/or use expensive materials must be used and many are required to heat or cool a home overnight or even more if it's cloudy for several days. The last problem is they use rare materials that are not a renewable resource and they require special production facilities to manufacture. There are some promising new technologies developing but  they only address some of these shortcomings.
	
The current implementation of large scale solar thermal farms has several issues and photovoltaics only worsen the problems. The plans call for large areas of the desert southwest to be covered with these farms. They have the attitude of that’s where the sun is and nothing much lives there so it would be perfect. There are several problems with this reasoning. The first is not many people live there either so the energy would have to be delivered over huge distances. There would be a significant loss of efficiency and so would require even more land to be covered to make up for those losses. There would also be the cost of building such a distribution system as the current electric grid is in need of updating as it is. The second reason is not all desert is barren wasteland, there is a very fragile ecosystem that would be disturbed to build these farms. The third reason has already been stated in the fact that these farms would still be owned by large corporations whose historical motivating force is profit. 

Larger solar thermal installations could be better integrated into the environment and even provide benefits to agriculture that could be done in the shade of higher mounted collectors. Large concentrated solar farms have their place in driving energetic industrial processes but should not be considered for supplying houses and businesses that don’t need that kind of power. 

We think that by individual buildings supplying its own water, food, and energy requirements and sharing with our neighbors the responsibility of directly supplying our needs we can achieve our goal of sustainability and go beyond into a regeneration of society and of life. The reason is many houses and businesses have the area needed to satisfy themselves plus a surplus area many times greater than that. The solar collectors can be mounted on building roofs to help shade them and reduce air conditioning loads. The collectors can be integrated into greenhouses providing plenty of diffuse light for plant growth while drastically reducing heating loads in the summer and the heat can be stored for heating the greenhouse in winter. The collectors can be mounted over gardens and ponds to shade them but allowing enough diffuse light for plant growth. This significantly reduces transpiration and evaporation so water is utilized much better. 

 Small businesses are especially suited as many are built with flat roofs that would allow for the mounting of solar collectors that could shade rooftop gardens. In fact many businesses such as retail stores could produce far more energy than they would themselves need and could then provide this to the local community. 

All this leads to a much more efficient system overall because power is used where it is generated and by using a single unit to produce all the various needs with the minimum of energy conversion efficiency is increased even more. There is also the reduction in the land used for both energy and agriculture if our yards were power producing edible gardens instead of the energy consuming, purely for the look of it, landscaped ones currently popular. 

There are many benefits of it being a thermal system. The first is that the heat can be stored in ways that risk very little damage to the environment and are less resource intensive compared to batteries. The primary thermal energy is collected from the sun but can easily be supplemented with biogas burners, biochar reactors and even wind can be converted to heat through viscous heaters. Also electric heaters, waste oil burners, propane and natural gas burners, heat from the exhaust of a stationary generator or pump engine could help to run the system in times when the sun is not shining.  

The heat can be used directly for things such as space heating, domestic hot water, cooking, clothes drying etc. The heat can also be converted in a Stirling engine to motive power to run an electric generator and to run machinery such as pumps, grain mills, tool machines etc. The heat can also be converted to refrigeration through the use of absorptive coolers and / or through running a second Stirling engine with the first. 

The system can still be tied to the electric grid to both receive power if needed and to supply excess power to others. This leads to a very different kind of energy economy where each house or business gives or receives power as needed. Essentially it turns energy from an expense into an asset.
