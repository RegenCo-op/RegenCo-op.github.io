## To understand the need for organizations like the REGENCO-OP we must begin with what is wrong with our current methods of producing, distributing and storing energy. 

The main theme that ties most of these technologies together is the fact that they focus on the current way of producing and distributing power and that’s through large power plants controlled by a power company distributing the power over a large electric grid.

### For the specific problems we will start with the non-renewable sources first:

* [Coal](#todo): Coal is mined in both underground mines and in open pits. These mines require huge amounts of energy to extract the ore from the ground. These mines also have very serious environmental impacts that don’t threaten just wildlife but also people directly. There is a lot of coal left so a shortage isn’t foreseen any time soon but by burning all that coal the environmental impact of that would be devastating 

* [Natural gas](#todo): It’s better than coal but the current rush to extract it uses fracking, a controversial method of pumping water underground at high pressure to break the rock apart and allow the gas to flow to the well.The  USGS has this to say about it: [NPR report on USGS statement on fracking causing earthquakes in Oklahoma.](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/05/05/309888859/usgs-okla-fracking-has-increased-chance-of-damaging-quake) There is lots of natural gas available too and because it is overall cleaner than coal will likely be used for quite some time. Again the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would be very detrimental to the environment. 

* [Oil](#todo): Has many of the same problems that coal and natural gas have however there is not nearly as much of it left and we are using more and more of it all the time. Because oil is used not just for fuel but for plastics and other products it has a higher demand. This demand is at the root of many of the wars that the USA has been involved in recent decades. Please see: [CNN report on Iraq War ten years later](http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/19/opinion/iraq-war-oil-juhasz/)

* [Nuclear](#todo): Nuclear would be great if it couldn’t be turned into a bomb or the waste potentially pollute the environment for eons. They also require mines to get the uranium and these are also a environmental hazard. Unfortunately this is an energy source that may be increased to keep up with demand and emissions regulation and keep costs competitive with renewable energy sources. 

* [Municipal solid waste](#todo):  These are touted by some as a renewable energy source. This is trying to cover up a major problem the USA has on its addiction to material things. There would not be such “waste” burned if materials were used efficiently. These power plants are not renewable, half of what they burn is plastic and tires and anything else that may have been thrown in the garbage. 

### Now for the energy sources with the potential to be renewable:

* [Human](#todo): Human energy is in the form of physical operations performed and mental operations performed. This energy is derived from our consumption of food and water. Industrial Agriculture is where the majority of people get their food and wells and large reservoirs is the source of their water, both of which have geopolitical, environmental and health issues associated with them. 
 
* [Geothermal](#todo): Geothermal can only be utilized at favorable locations at the moment due to the cost of drilling and it would not be cost effective to use on a small scale. As drilling technology advances and the costs of fossil fuels goes up this will be used by large industrial applications in locations that didn’t used to be possible. As fracking has shown we are still learning the consequences of drilling into the earth so its use should be done with caution.

* [Solar](#todo): Solar energy is utilized in five ways; hydroelectric, biomass, wind, solar thermal, and photovoltaics.
  
  * [Hydroelectric](#todo): The hydrologic cycle is from the evaporation of water from the oceans and lakes and the transpiration from plants.  In both of these processes the energy is derived directly from the sun. Hydroelectric is a renewable energy source, however how it is currently implemented it causes damage to the ecosystems of rivers and floods land that could be used in other ways. There are ways of harnessing the power of a river without damming it. There are people who are lucky enough to have a stream on their property who do small scale hydroelectric. There are lots of issues the world faces regarding water. Some argue it’s more a pressing issue than energy so we need to be careful in how we use it. See this [Smithsonian article about the Colorado river: the colorado river runs dry]( http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-colorado-river-runs-dry-61427169/?no-ist)

  * [Biomass](#todo): Biomass is plants and algae that utilize photosynthesis, another process that is energized by the sun. Biomass is very renewable but only if done carefully. Ethanol produced from corn is not a good choice because by using a food crop you are taking it from the mouth of a hungry person. The other issue is the energy required to make the fertilizer, harvest the corn process it into ethanol then transport it to where it’s needed. Other forms such as methane from landfills or from sewage treatment plants make sense as they are preventing the methane from getting into the air, they make power doing it and don’t use any new land in their construction. These biodigesters can also be easily scaled to that of the individual home, in fact traditional septic systems are biodigesters that do not trap and utilize the methane, water and nutrients produced. The other important form of biomass energy production is biochar. Biochar is the pyrolysis of organic matter to release the volatile gases that can be used as fuel and a byproduct of high quality charcoal. The charcoal can be then "seasoned" and mixed with soil to create Terra Prata, a highly productive soil. This form of carbon is very stable and so is a way of sequestering carbon in the soil for hundreds and possibly thousands of years. 

  * [Wind](#todo):  Wind results from the uneven heating of the planet by the sun. Wind is currently being used on both large and small scales. If done properly wind is a very good source of renewable energy. The large wind farms have some of the same issues as the large solar farms such as good locations for these farms doesn’t usually coincide with where people are living so the same problems of inefficiency of transmission over long distances and the costs associated with new infrastructure. The large wind farms don’t disrupt the land nearly as much as the solar farms so it can still be utilized or left natural. Some have raised concerns over noise, visual pollution or bird and bat kills but these are  minor issues when compared to problems that renewable energy is helping to solve. Many small scale wind turbines are either not as advertised or the site evaluation has not been done to ensure it’s a good investment and/or is installed improperly and don’t perform up to the consumers expectations. The same complaints are used against small scale wind turbines as the large scale ones but they still must be weighed against the alternatives. 
 
  * [Solar thermal](#todo): Solar thermal can be either unconcentrated or concentrated:

    This is a map showing the average energy in kWh/m2 received in a day and over a year. As you can see most of the planet receives generous amounts of sunlight. Click [here](#todo) for more information.
          
    * [Unconcentrated solar thermal](#todo) systems use flat plate collectors or vacuum tube collectors without any mirrors. They can reach temperatures over 100 C but max out around 200 C. They are simple and reliable but are limited to processes that can be done around 100 C. These processes include  hot water for showering, laundry, dishes and for space heating through radiators or underfloor heating, 
    
    * [Concentrated solar thermal](#todo) use mirrors or lenses to focus the sun's rays to reach temperatures above 200 C. With higher temperature comes greater thermodynamic efficiency and the ability to store energy with a much greater useful capacity per mass. These systems can easily generate temperatures of 400 C and so can efficiently run an engine. This engine can be coupled to an electric generator or most machinery. These temperatures are also high enough to cook food. The "waste" heat from running the engine or cooking is high enough to be used for heating water for showering, laundry, dishes, and for space heating through radiators or subfloor heating. 
  
  * [Photovoltaics](#todo): The biggest problem with photovoltaics is they only make low voltage DC current. They are getting better all the time at doing that but that’s still all they do. This low voltage DC current must be converted to a higher voltage AC current to work the appliances in our homes and businesses and this is inefficient. The actual electrical usage of things that could not operate on some other energy source is small in the home and many small businesses. The biggest usage in power comes from heating things up and cooling things down. Electricity must be converted to do these things so efficiency is lost. Another problem with them is the way they store energy. By using batteries toxic and/or expensive materials must be used and many are required to heat or cool a home over several days of bad weather. The last problem is they use rare materials that are not a renewable resource and directly compete with computer chip manufacturing. They also require the same special production facilities to manufacture as computer chips. There are some promising new technologies developing but  they only address some of these shortcomings. This is a good article explaining in much more detail: [The ugly side of solar panels](http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2008/03/the-ugly-side-o.html). They are especially a bad idea when used in solar farms see Concentrated solar farms below.
  
  * [Large scale concentrated solar farm](#todo): The problems with solar farms, and using photovoltaics only makes these issues worse, is that to create the current level of energy use would require huge areas to be covered with these farms. Some have said well just put them in the desert. They have the attitude of that’s where the sun is and nothing much lives there so it would be perfect. There are several problems with this reasoning. The first is not many people live there either so the energy would have to be delivered over huge distances. There would be a significant loss of efficiency and so would require even more land to be covered to make up for those losses. There would also be the cost of building such a distribution system as the current electric grid is in need of updating as it is. The second reason is not all desert is barren wasteland, there is a very fragile ecosystem that would be disturbed to build these farms. Large concentrated solar farms may have their place in driving energetic industrial processes but should not be considered for supplying houses and businesses that don’t need that kind of power.
